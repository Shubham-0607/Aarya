  <p>Happy Birthday Aarya! 🎉 I just want you to know how much having you in my life means to me. You have been there through my happiest moments and my lowest ones, helping me, supporting me, just being you. Sometimes I catch myself thinking about what it would feel like if this bond ever broke, and honestly, that thought scares me—but it also makes me realize how deeply I treasure what we have. Yes, there are times when you make me angry or sad, but its okay… we can forget it. For today only! 😂😂 Thank you for being in my life and for making even the simplest moments feel special.

Just stay the way you are, dont ever turn back into a person instead of a cat. Byee!!!!! 😊😊😊"</p>
